# Code interview portfolio

This is my code interview portfolio. The purpose of this repository is to provide a variety of coding examples, some complete applications, some code interview style short exercises. The goal is to provide solutions to commonly asked questions and showcase my skills and experience. All of the code presented was written by myself in its entirety (unless noted otherwise).

## core31 and net45

Code interview snippets, on .NET Core 3.1 and .NET Framework 4.5 respectively

## Mars Rovers

rovers/* is one potential answer to the apparently popular [Mars Rovers](http://www.techinterviewpuzzles.com/2010/09/mars-rovers-thoughtworks-puzzles.html) homework interview question.

## EPPlayer

EPPlayer is a 2012 Windows desktop application built on XAML and what now appears to be called UWP. EPPlayer was written to support the posthuman role-playing game _Eclipse Phase_. It has some interesting uses of observables and eventing. It likely also demonstrates my UI design skills are limited ;-) But if you wanted another project to look at, or see how much my development skills have improved over time, dive right in!
