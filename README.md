# Code interview portfolio

This is my code interview portfolio. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills and experience by providing some complete projects, as well as answers to common whiteboard coding questions. All of the code presented was written by myself (except some open source code reuse in EPPlayer, credited there).

## Mars Rovers

The Rover project is one potential answer to the apparently popular [Mars Rovers](http://www.techinterviewpuzzles.com/2010/09/mars-rovers-thoughtworks-puzzles.html) homework interview question. Please see the readme in that folder for more information.

## core31 and net45

Code interview snippets, on .NET Core 3.1 and .NET Framework 4.5 respectively

## EPPlayer

EPPlayer is a 2012 Windows desktop application built on XAML and what now appears to be called UWP. EPPlayer was written to support the posthuman role-playing game _Eclipse Phase_. It has some interesting uses of observables and eventing. It likely also demonstrates my UI design skills are limited ;-) But if you wanted another project to look at, or see how much my development skills have improved over time, dive right in!
